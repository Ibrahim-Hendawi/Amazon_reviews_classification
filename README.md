# Amazon_reviews_classification
In this repository, we used the [Amazon Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews) to make a stars classifier for reviews
we make a DeepLearning Model that has LSTM in its structure.


In [test notebook](https://github.com/Ibrahim-Hendawi/Amazon_reviews_classification/blob/main/test.ipynb) we loaded the model and the tokenizer and makes a function that takes a review in the list and applied the tokenizer and padding then pass it to the model to predict the class that review belongs to and then make a threshold to classifies the stars ( how this review is positive or negative)
